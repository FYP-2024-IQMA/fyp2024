The Chameleon Effect Research has also shown that mimicking someone\\nwill make them more agreeable towards you. It's called the chameleon effect\\nTry copying their posture or body language and they might be more likely to\\nhelp you out\\n\\n3. Don't get caught rambling when it comes to the art of persuasion, less is\\nmore Instead of listing all the various reasons why you're right and they're\\nwrong focus on one or two main points of the most. One good reason is ideal\\n\\n4. Start small. This is known as the foot in the door technique Basically what\\nthis means is that if you ask someone for a small favor such as borrowing a\\nquarter They're more likely to continue doing favors for you, even big ones!\\nBut if you just start off with asking to borrow their car, you might have less\\nsuccess\\n\\n5. Status Status is important when asking people for favors Use their official\\ntitles such as doctor mister professor And don't forget to use their name\\nPeople love to hear their own name and they like to feel respected\\n\\n6.

So, what can we do\\nto become better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one\\nconversation is about taking an interest in another person and making them\\nfeel understood. There’s no universally agreed upon definition of high-\\nquality listening, but some recurring features include attentiveness,\\nconveying understanding, and showing a positive intention towards the\\nspeaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply go through the motions—\\nresearchers have found that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals\\ndoesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly performative about\\nlistening in that it’s important to show you’re doing it. So, in addition to\\nactively attending to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions\\nand body language that indicate their understanding and their desire to\\nunderstand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective\\nmight depend on your relationship with the speaker. But with time and\\npractice you can internalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend\\nwants to tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before\\neven starting your conversation, remove any distractions in the\\nenvironment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones and put your phone\\naway— far away. One study showed that even the visible presence of a\\nphone made conversations feel less intimate and fulfilling to those involved.\\nOnce the conversation begins, one of the most important things you can do\\nis also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean you need to\\nstay completely silent. But if you do interject, look for natural pauses to ask\\nopen-ended questions that benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity.\\nQuestions like “What happened next?”or “How did that make you feel?”\\nconfirm that you’re following the story while also helping the speaker dive\\ndeeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your\\nunderstanding is by summarizing what you just heard and asking if you’ve\\nmissed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that you're truly\\ntrying to understand them rather than just waiting for your turn to talk.\\nSpeaking of which, while a good conversation requires back and forth,\\nplanning out your response while the speaker is talking is a common way to\\nmiss what’s being said. So try to stay present and if you lose focus, don't be\\nshy about asking the speaker to repeat what you missed.

Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to\\nask for a moment to formulate your response and taking a beat to think can\\nhelp speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small\\nchanges, but together they make a big difference. And when people feel\\nheard, they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection in their\\nrelationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard generally\\nexperience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened to them\\nmore favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be easy to listen to some\\npeople, it can be hard to muster all this focus and attention if you disagree\\nwith or dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually benefit most\\nfrom your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance\\nsuggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them\\nmore likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest\\nthat high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating a non-\\njudgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-\\nminded listening isn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not\\nthe same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have to end with a happy\\nresolution.

Have you\\never presented an idea to a group and it\\'s met with utter confusion? Or\\nmaybe you\\'ve been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses\\nyou of not listening to what they\\'re saying at all? What\\'s going on here? The\\nanswer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we\\'ve all\\nexperienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or\\neven crashing a multimilliondollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is\\neven when face-to-face with another person, in the very same room, and\\nspeaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex.\\nBut the good news is that a basic understanding of what happens when we\\ncommunicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades,\\nresearchers have asked,\"What happens when we communicate?\" One\\ninterpretation, called the transmission model, views communication as a\\nmessage that moves directly from one person to another, similar to someone\\ntossing a ball and walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn\\'t\\naccount for communication\\'s complexity. Enter the transactional model,\\nwhich acknowledges the many added challenges of communicating. With\\nthis model, it\\'s more accurate to think of communication between people as\\na game of catch. As we communicate our message, we receive feedback\\nfrom the other party. Through the transaction, we create meaning together.\\nBut from this exchange, further complications arise. It\\'s not like the Star\\nTrek universe, where some characters can Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing\\nthoughts and feelings. As humans, we can\\'t help but sendand receive\\nmessages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one\\nperson expresses her interpretation of a message, and the person she\\'s\\ncommunicating with hears his own interpretation of that message. Our\\nperceptual filters continually shift meanings and interpretations. Remember\\nthat game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches\\nit, they shape it to fit their own unique perceptions based on any number of\\nvariables, like knowledge or past experience, age, race, gender, ethnicity,\\nreligion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets the\\nmessage they receive based on their relationship with the other person, and\\ntheir unique understanding of the semantics and connotations of the exact\\nwords being used. They could also be distracted by other stimuli, such as\\ntraffic or a growling stomach.

But, luckily,\\nthere are some simple practices that can help us all navigate our daily\\ninteractions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing\\nand active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal and\\nnonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate greater\\nunderstanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,as well as with your gut.\\nRemember that communication is more than just words. Three: take time to\\nunderstand as you tryto be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it\\'s\\neasy to forget that communicationis a two-way street. Be open to what the\\nother person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal\\nperceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture,\\ncommunity, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, \"This is how I\\nsee the problem,but how do you see it?\" Don\\'t assume that your perceptionis\\nthe objective truth.

And to do that, you have to\\nknow as much about your audience as possible. So let\\'s talk about how to\\nanalyze your audience for public speaking. The old public speaking triangle\\nhas a lot of wisdom built into it. In any situation you havethe speaker, that\\'s\\nyou, you have the message, and then the audience. A lot of new presenters\\nmake the mistake of thinking that it\\'s mainly about them as the speaker.\\nThey want to make the audience like them for example, or they wanna focus\\nmostly on what\\'s on their mind personally. They think of listeners as a\\ncaptive audience and it\\'s their opportunity as a speaker to shine. Well, I\\nhave some news for you. The audience is probably not there for that. They\\'re\\nthere for their own benefits. Every single listener in your audience, whether\\nthey realize it or not, is asking themselves some version of the same\\nquestion. Why should I care? What\\'s in it for me? What do I get out of this?\\nAnd on the surface, those may sound like self-centered questions, but I think\\nit\\'s entirely fair and appropriate to answer those questions for your\\naudience. What\\'s in it for them. In fact, you are asking yourself those\\nquestions anytime you\\'re watching a speaker. People are trading their time\\nfor what you may have to say. So I think it\\'s important to make sure your\\nmessage speaks to them personally. I recommend that you take an audience-\\ncentered approach. Let\\'s talk about some ways you can get to know your\\naudience beforehand. There\\'s some really obvious ways to get a quick glance\\nat your listeners, like the general age of your audience, gender, and other\\ndemographic factors. This information is usually right on the surface and\\neasy to learn about, and it can certainly help you tailor your message to that\\nparticular audience. Maybe you\\'re speaking to a specific and official group.\\nYou can tell a lot about your listeners based upon their group affiliation\\nbecause they joined that group. They\\'re part of that group for a set of\\nreasons. I spoke to a group of about 40 nurses in a hospital once, and that\\ninstantly told me a lot about what they cared about. And so I customized my\\nmessage so it spoke directly to them. Once you get past the basics, you get\\ninto more specifics about the listeners\\' disposition toward the topic. This is a\\nphrase I pulled from \"The Art of Public Speaking\" by Stephen Lucas. It\\'s a\\nclassic book. The audience\\'s disposition toward the topic, include their\\ninterest, knowledge and attitude. So what\\'s their interest level? Are they\\nshowing up for your presentation because they want to be there or because', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

That will shape how you\\ntailor your message to them. You may wanna spend a little time in your\\nmessage directly explaining the value of what you're saying to get them\\nmore interested, for example. Next is knowledge. What do they already\\nknow about your subject? Are they just hearing about this for the first time?\\nOr are they already experts on it? That's gonna shape the way you prepare\\nin advance and deliver your message in the moment. And what's their\\nattitude? This is especially important. If there's any kind of persuasive\\nelement to your message, you have to know wheretheir attitude is currently.\\nWe'll call that point A. So you have a starting place to convince them to your\\npoint of view. Point B, I had to learn the interest knowledge level and\\nattitude about that group of nurses I was speaking to to make sure my\\nmessage hit the right target. The challenge is interest level, knowledge, and\\ntheir attitude might not be right on the surface. That means you have to\\ngather this information about your audience ahead of time. And there are\\ntwo key ways to do this. One way, which I have sometime seen used in\\nprofess settings and I've done this myself, is to give your audience\\nquestionnaires or surveys maybe a few weeks in advance. You can ask them\\nanything you want that would help you adjust your message. But the second\\nway to gather information is the one I have seen use the most in professional\\nsettings. You have a long and detailed conversation with the person who is\\ntrying to book you for the event, the person inviting you to speak in the first\\nplace. Essentially, if someone has already asked you to speak, they know the\\ninformation and will usually be happy to share that with you. They want your\\nworkshop, your presentation or whatever it is to go well because they\\ninvited you to speak and that reflects on them. I was asked to speak to a\\ngroup of emerging leaders a while back. This was for a government client\\nand I spent about two hours worth maybe more with the person who invited\\nme to speak. They told me everything Ineeded to know to tailor and\\ncustomize almost every single part of that presentation. Sometimes this\\npoint person is the one who is organizing the overall event. And other times\\nthis will just be the supervisor of the team that you might be speaking to. I\\nalways make it a point to talk to the team supervisor. They are probably the\\nvery best person to give you any kind of information that might help you\\ntailor your message. And then the last step isto go back to your message and\\nadjust it in every possible way so that everything speaks directly to that\\nparticular audience. You don't want your messageto sound ordinary and\\ngeneric. You want your examples, illustrations, even the specific research\\nthat you cite, and advice you give to hit the center of that target. When I was\\nworking with government client, I mentioned this point person was amazing.\\nHe offered to look at all the early versions of my notes and slides and the\\nsmall workbook I was creating specifically for them. We went through every\\nsingle page together in detail to make sure that workshop was a big hit. And\\nit went really well.

Once you\\ndo a favor for someone else They'll be more likely to help you in return with\\nwhatever you ask them\\n\\n2. The Chameleon Effect Research has also shown that mimicking someone\\nwill make them more agreeable towards you. It's called the chameleon effect\\nTry copying their posture or body language and they might be more likely to\\nhelp you out\\n\\n3. Don't get caught rambling when it comes to the art of persuasion, less is\\nmore Instead of listing all the various reasons why you're right and they're\\nwrong focus on one or two main points of the most. One good reason is ideal\\n\\n4. Start small. This is known as the foot in the door technique Basically what\\nthis means is that if you ask someone for a small favor such as borrowing a\\nquarter They're more likely to continue doing favors for you, even big ones!\\nBut if you just start off with asking to borrow their car, you might have less\\nsuccess\\n\\n5. Status Status is important when asking people for favors Use their official\\ntitles such as doctor mister professor And don't forget to use their name\\nPeople love to hear their own name and they like to feel respected\\n\\n6. Speak faster. Are you a fast talker? Well, if you want to convince people\\nthat you're right, quickly getting your point across can be an advantage\\naccording to research Speaking quickly overwhelms their brains and doesn't\\ngive them a chance to form a rebuttal\"),\n",

Contrasting Every salesman knows this technique. Start big and back\\ndown, but the key here is to ask for more than what you actually want\\nEventually, you can scale back your demands and you\\'ll be left with what\\nyou originally wanted in the first place\\n\\n8. Repetition Bias This is also known as the Goebbels effect Repeating the\\nsame lie often enough will eventually convince people If you continue to\\nrepeat your opinion, even if it\\'s wrong people will be more likely to accept it\\n\\n9. Wait till they\\'re tired. If you\\'re trying to convince someone, wait till\\nthey\\'re tired Research has shown that critical thinking goes out of the\\nwindow when people are tired and they\\'re more likely to agree with\\nwhatever you\\'re saying\\n\\n10. Remind them of the benefits When trying to convince someone to do\\nsomething or to take a particular opinion always phrase your argument in\\nterms of how they benefit Always mention what you\\'re offering them before\\nyou talk about what you want from them?\\n\\n11. Priming A very interesting method is priming. There are many ways to\\ndo this and you can really get creative What it really boils down to is\\nsubstantially reminding people or encouraging people to do something or\\ntake a particular opinion The classic example is if you want someone to write\\nyou a check make sure there\\'s a checkbook nearby when you ask But that\\'s\\njust scratching the surface when it comes to priming and there are plenty\\nmore examples of how this can work\\n\\n12. Sensationalism. Get excited about whatever you\\'re selling even if that\\'s\\nan opinion Make sure the person thinks that the time is running out There\\'s\\na limited supply if they don\\'t act now the opportunity will go away. You\\'ve\\nprobably seen this a lot in commercials\\n\\n13. Make sure people are watching. This one only works if you\\'re trying to\\nconvince someone to do the right thing and Why wouldn\\'t you be doing that?\\nAnyway, when people are watching Individuals feel like they\\'re being judged\\nby society at large. So they\\'re more likely to do the right thing\\n\\n14. Choose your words carefully Words have incredible power over people\\nsay please and thank you. Don\\'t use big complicated words It insults their\\nintelligence. Nouns have more convincing power than Verbs. \"Help her\"\\ninstead of \"Help\". There are countless examples of beneficial words and\\nonce to stay away from\\n\\n15. Get your friends to agree with you.

So, what can we do\\nto become better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one\\nconversation is about taking an interest in another person and making them\\nfeel understood. There’s no universally agreed upon definition of high-\\nquality listening, but some recurring features include attentiveness,\\nconveying understanding, and showing a positive intention towards the\\nspeaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply go through the motions—\\nresearchers have found that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals\\ndoesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly performative about\\nlistening in that it’s important to show you’re doing it. So, in addition to\\nactively attending to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions\\nand body language that indicate their understanding and their desire to\\nunderstand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective\\nmight depend on your relationship with the speaker. But with time and\\npractice you can internalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend\\nwants to tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before\\neven starting your conversation, remove any distractions in the\\nenvironment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones and put your phone\\naway— far away. One study showed that even the visible presence of a\\nphone made conversations feel less intimate and fulfilling to those involved.\\nOnce the conversation begins, one of the most important things you can do\\nis also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean you need to\\nstay completely silent. But if you do interject, look for natural pauses to ask\\nopen-ended questions that benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity.\\nQuestions like “What happened next?”or “How did that make you feel?”\\nconfirm that you’re following the story while also helping the speaker dive\\ndeeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your\\nunderstanding is by summarizing what you just heard and asking if you’ve\\nmissed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that you're truly\\ntrying to understand them rather than just waiting for your turn to talk.\\nSpeaking of which, while a good conversation requires back and forth,\\nplanning out your response while the speaker is talking is a common way to\\nmiss what’s being said. So try to stay present and if you lose focus, don't be\\nshy about asking the speaker to repeat what you missed. This might feel\"),\n",

Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to\\nask for a moment to formulate your response and taking a beat to think can\\nhelp speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small\\nchanges, but together they make a big difference. And when people feel\\nheard, they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection in their\\nrelationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard generally\\nexperience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened to them\\nmore favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be easy to listen to some\\npeople, it can be hard to muster all this focus and attention if you disagree\\nwith or dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually benefit most\\nfrom your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance\\nsuggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them\\nmore likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest\\nthat high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating a non-\\njudgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-\\nminded listening isn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not\\nthe same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have to end with a happy\\nresolution. But even during a disagreement, sometimes being heard is\\nenough to start a deeper conversation.'),\n",

Have you\\never presented an idea to a group and it\\'s met with utter confusion? Or\\nmaybe you\\'ve been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses\\nyou of not listening to what they\\'re saying at all? What\\'s going on here? The\\nanswer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we\\'ve all\\nexperienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or\\neven crashing a multimilliondollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is\\neven when face-to-face with another person, in the very same room, and\\nspeaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex.\\nBut the good news is that a basic understanding of what happens when we\\ncommunicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades,\\nresearchers have asked,\"What happens when we communicate?\" One\\ninterpretation, called the transmission model, views communication as a\\nmessage that moves directly from one person to another, similar to someone\\ntossing a ball and walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn\\'t\\naccount for communication\\'s complexity. Enter the transactional model,\\nwhich acknowledges the many added challenges of communicating. With\\nthis model, it\\'s more accurate to think of communication between people as\\na game of catch. As we communicate our message, we receive feedback\\nfrom the other party. Through the transaction, we create meaning together.\\nBut from this exchange, further complications arise. It\\'s not like the Star\\nTrek universe, where some characters can Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing\\nthoughts and feelings. As humans, we can\\'t help but sendand receive\\nmessages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one\\nperson expresses her interpretation of a message, and the person she\\'s\\ncommunicating with hears his own interpretation of that message. Our\\nperceptual filters continually shift meanings and interpretations. Remember\\nthat game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches\\nit, they shape it to fit their own unique perceptions based on any number of\\nvariables, like knowledge or past experience, age, race, gender, ethnicity,\\nreligion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets the\\nmessage they receive based on their relationship with the other person, and\\ntheir unique understanding of the semantics and connotations of the exact\\nwords being used. They could also be distracted by other stimuli, such as\\ntraffic or a growling stomach. Even emotion might cloud their\\nunderstanding, and by adding more people into a conversation, each with'),\n",

One: recognize that passive hearing\\nand active listening are not the same.

Two: listen with your eyes and ears,as well as with your gut.\\nRemember that communication is more than just words. Three: take time to\\nunderstand as you tryto be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it\\'s\\neasy to forget that communicationis a two-way street. Be open to what the\\nother person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal\\nperceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture,\\ncommunity, and family, influence how you see the world.

And to do that, you have to\\nknow as much about your audience as possible. So let\\'s talk about how to\\nanalyze your audience for public speaking. The old public speaking triangle\\nhas a lot of wisdom built into it. In any situation you havethe speaker, that\\'s\\nyou, you have the message, and then the audience. A lot of new presenters\\nmake the mistake of thinking that it\\'s mainly about them as the speaker.\\nThey want to make the audience like them for example, or they wanna focus\\nmostly on what\\'s on their mind personally. They think of listeners as a\\ncaptive audience and it\\'s their opportunity as a speaker to shine. Well, I\\nhave some news for you. The audience is probably not there for that. They\\'re\\nthere for their own benefits. Every single listener in your audience, whether\\nthey realize it or not, is asking themselves some version of the same\\nquestion. Why should I care? What\\'s in it for me? What do I get out of this?\\nAnd on the surface, those may sound like self-centered questions, but I think\\nit\\'s entirely fair and appropriate to answer those questions for your\\naudience. What\\'s in it for them. In fact, you are asking yourself those\\nquestions anytime you\\'re watching a speaker. People are trading their time\\nfor what you may have to say. So I think it\\'s important to make sure your\\nmessage speaks to them personally. I recommend that you take an audience-\\ncentered approach. Let\\'s talk about some ways you can get to know your\\naudience beforehand. There\\'s some really obvious ways to get a quick glance\\nat your listeners, like the general age of your audience, gender, and other\\ndemographic factors. This information is usually right on the surface and\\neasy to learn about, and it can certainly help you tailor your message to that\\nparticular audience. Maybe you\\'re speaking to a specific and official group.\\nYou can tell a lot about your listeners based upon their group affiliation\\nbecause they joined that group. They\\'re part of that group for a set of\\nreasons. I spoke to a group of about 40 nurses in a hospital once, and that\\ninstantly told me a lot about what they cared about. And so I customized my\\nmessage so it spoke directly to them. Once you get past the basics, you get\\ninto more specifics about the listeners\\' disposition toward the topic. This is a\\nphrase I pulled from \"The Art of Public Speaking\" by Stephen Lucas. It\\'s a\\nclassic book. The audience\\'s disposition toward the topic, include their\\ninterest, knowledge and attitude. So what\\'s their interest level? Are they\\nshowing up for your presentation because they want to be there or because'),\n",

That will shape how you\\ntailor your message to them. You may wanna spend a little time in your\\nmessage directly explaining the value of what you're saying to get them\\nmore interested, for example. Next is knowledge. What do they already\\nknow about your subject? Are they just hearing about this for the first time?\\nOr are they already experts on it? That's gonna shape the way you prepare\\nin advance and deliver your message in the moment. And what's their\\nattitude? This is especially important. If there's any kind of persuasive\\nelement to your message, you have to know wheretheir attitude is currently.\\nWe'll call that point A. So you have a starting place to convince them to your\\npoint of view. Point B, I had to learn the interest knowledge level and\\nattitude about that group of nurses I was speaking to to make sure my\\nmessage hit the right target. The challenge is interest level, knowledge, and\\ntheir attitude might not be right on the surface. That means you have to\\ngather this information about your audience ahead of time. And there are\\ntwo key ways to do this. One way, which I have sometime seen used in\\nprofess settings and I've done this myself, is to give your audience\\nquestionnaires or surveys maybe a few weeks in advance. You can ask them\\nanything you want that would help you adjust your message. But the second\\nway to gather information is the one I have seen use the most in professional\\nsettings. You have a long and detailed conversation with the person who is\\ntrying to book you for the event, the person inviting you to speak in the first\\nplace. Essentially, if someone has already asked you to speak, they know the\\ninformation and will usually be happy to share that with you. They want your\\nworkshop, your presentation or whatever it is to go well because they\\ninvited you to speak and that reflects on them. I was asked to speak to a\\ngroup of emerging leaders a while back. This was for a government client\\nand I spent about two hours worth maybe more with the person who invited\\nme to speak. They told me everything Ineeded to know to tailor and\\ncustomize almost every single part of that presentation. Sometimes this\\npoint person is the one who is organizing the overall event. And other times\\nthis will just be the supervisor of the team that you might be speaking to. I\\nalways make it a point to talk to the team supervisor. They are probably the\\nvery best person to give you any kind of information that might help you\\ntailor your message. And then the last step isto go back to your message and\\nadjust it in every possible way so that everything speaks directly to that\\nparticular audience. You don't want your messageto sound ordinary and\\ngeneric. You want your examples, illustrations, even the specific research\\nthat you cite, and advice you give to hit the center of that target. When I was\\nworking with government client, I mentioned this point person was amazing.\\nHe offered to look at all the early versions of my notes and slides and the\\nsmall workbook I was creating specifically for them. We went through every\\nsingle page together in detail to make sure that workshop was a big hit. And\\nit went really well. If we look at this public speaking triangle, one more time.\"),\n",
