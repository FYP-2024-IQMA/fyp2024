      "Processing line: 00:03:18.560 outside emergencies and possibly warfare\n",

      "Processing line: 00:03:25.599 i don't think so\n",

      "Processing line: 00:03:37.200 integrity\n",

      "Processing line: 00:03:56.799 illustrate\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:58.000 different types of manipulation\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:00.400 the first is using guilt\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:02.879 or emotional blackmail\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:05.200 if you don't help out on this one then\n",

      "Processing line: 00:04:19.279 a much better chance if you did it\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:22.800 the third is creating fear\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:25.919 if you don't offer me that extra\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:28.160 discount then i'll go online\n",

      "Processing line: 00:04:45.919 we wouldn't appreciate that\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:49.120 if you don't use integrity\n",

      "Processing line: 00:00:06.230 The art of persuasion is a subtle complex discipline which requires skill but lucky for all our viewers out there\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:12.550 We are gonna let you in on 15 useful tricks hidden in the enormous wealth of psychological knowledge\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:18.680 Millions of people all over the world have been swindling manipulating and persuading people with great success, but how do they do it?\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:25.200 well\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:26.020 If you understand how the human brain works and what makes people tick\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:29.260 You too can learn how to make people do pretty much whatever you want\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:32.840 The only question is whether you'll use this power for good or for evil\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:38.120 1.The Reciprocity Norm\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:40.520 The Reciprocity norm is a pretty simple concept and one of the most powerful ways to convince others to do something for you\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:46.900 What it all boils down to is you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:50.920 Once you do a favor for someone else\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:52.720 They'll be more likely to help you in return with whatever you ask them\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:57.000 2. The Chameleon Effect\n",
      "Processing line: 00:00:59.200 Research has also shown that mimicking someone will make them more agreeable towards you. It's called the chameleon effect\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:05.180 Try copying their posture or body language and they might be more likely to help you out\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:10.700 3. Don't get caught rambling\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:13.700 when it comes to the art of persuasion, less is more\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:17.060 Instead of listing all the various reasons why you're right and they're wrong\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:20.980 focus on one or two main points of the most. One good reason is ideal\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:26.140 4. Start small. This is known as the foot in the door technique\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:30.860 Basically what this means is that if you ask someone for a small favor such as borrowing a quarter\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:35.439 They're more likely to continue doing favors for you, even big ones!\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:39.340 But if you just start off with asking to borrow their car, you might have less success\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:44.960 5. Status\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:47.080 Status is important when asking people for favors\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:49.960 Use their official titles such as doctor mister professor\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:53.530 And don't forget to use their name\n",
      "Processing line: 00:01:55.940 People love to hear their own name and they like to feel respected\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:00.360 6. Speak faster. Are you a fast talker?\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:04.460 Well, if you want to convince people that you're right, quickly getting your point across can be an advantage according to research\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:11.060 Speaking quickly overwhelms their brains and doesn't give them a chance to form a rebuttal\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:15.960 7. Contrasting\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:18.280 Every salesman knows this technique.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:20.480 Start big and back down, but the key here is to ask for more than what you actually want\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:26.140 Eventually, you can scale back your demands and you'll be left with what you originally wanted in the first place\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:31.800 8. Repetition Bias\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:34.080 This is also known as the Goebbels effect\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:37.040 Repeating the same lie often enough will eventually convince people\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:40.030 If you continue to repeat your opinion, even if it's wrong people will be more likely to accept it\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:46.400 9. Wait till they're tired. If you're trying to convince someone, wait till they're tired\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:52.780 Research has shown that critical thinking goes out of the window when people are tired\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:56.940 and they're more likely to agree with whatever you're saying\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:00.540 10. Remind them of the benefits\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:03.019 When trying to convince someone to do something or to take a particular opinion always phrase your argument in terms of how they benefit\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:10.660 Always mention what you're offering them before you talk about what you want from them?\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:15.400 11. Priming\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:17.480 A very interesting method is priming. There are many ways to do this and you can really get creative\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:23.020 What it really boils down to is substantially reminding people or encouraging people to do something or take a particular opinion\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:30.440 The classic example is if you want someone to write you a check make sure there's a checkbook nearby when you ask\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:36.460 But that's just scratching the surface when it comes to priming and there are plenty more examples of how this can work\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:42.920 12. Sensationalism. Get excited about whatever you're selling even if that's an opinion\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:49.120 Make sure the person thinks that the time is running out\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:51.760 There's a limited supply if they don't act now the opportunity will go away. You've probably seen this a lot in commercials\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:59.860 13. Make sure people are watching. This one only works if you're trying to convince someone to do the right thing and\n",

      "Processing line: 00:01:14.070 good listeners also use questionsand body language\n",

      "Processing line: 00:02:51.840 because they want to be there\n",

      "Processing line: 00:02:56.210 That will shape how youtailor your message to them.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:02:59.170 You may wanna spend a little time\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:00.680 in your message directlyexplaining the value\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:03.410 of what you're saying\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:04.680 to get them more interested, for example.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:07.100 Next is knowledge.\n",

      "Processing line: 00:03:11.660 Are they just hearing aboutthis for the first time?\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:14.090 Or are they already experts on it?\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:15.850 That's gonna shape theway you prepare in advance\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:18.017 and and deliver yourmessage in the moment.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:20.550 And what's their attitude?\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:21.870 This is especially important.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:23.430 If there's any kind of persuasiveelement to your message,\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:26.390 you have to know wheretheir attitude is currently.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:29.350 We'll call that point A.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:30.780 So you have a startingplace to convince them\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:33.200 to your point of view.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:34.310 Point B, I had to learn theinterest knowledge level\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:38.090 and attitude about that groupof nurses I was speaking to\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:41.520 to make sure my messagehit the right target.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:43.690 The challenge is interestlevel, knowledge,\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:47.310 and their attitude mightnot be right on the surface.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:50.000 That means you have togather this information\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:52.340 about your audience ahead of times.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:54.000 And there are two key ways to do this.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:56.190 One way, which I have sometime seen used\n",
      "Processing line: 00:03:59.040 in profess settings\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:00.090 and I've done this myself,\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:01.220 is to give your audiencequestionnaires or surveys\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:04.100 maybe a few weeks in advance.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:06.070 You can ask them anything you want\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:08.050 that would help you adjust your message.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:10.290 But the second way to gather information\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:12.720 is the one I have seen use the most\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:14.700 in professional settings.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:16.410 You have a long and detailed conversation\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:19.220 with the person who is tryingto book you for the event,\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:21.829 the person inviting you tospeak in the first place.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:24.860 Essentially, if someone hasalready asked you to speak,\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:28.070 they know the information\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:30.110 and will usually be happyto share that with you.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:32.900 They want your workshop, your presentation\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:35.330 or whatever it is to go well\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:37.450 because they invited you to speak\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:38.850 and that reflects on them.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:40.540 I was asked to speak\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:41.980 to a group of emergingleaders a while back.\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:44.210 This was for a government client\n",
      "Processing line: 00:04:46.100 and I spent about two hours worth\n",
